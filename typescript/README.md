# TypeScript exercises

This folder contains solved TypeScript exercises from [exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises)

Tests are running with Jest, so I've followed instructions from [Jest oficial docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and (ts-jest)[https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/getting-started/installation/#jest-config-file] to configure dependencies, repository structure and so.

Test files are the same as defined in each exercise, but applying minor changes (i.e: change `xit` )

## How to operate

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run tests

```bash
yarn test [./exercise-folder]
```
