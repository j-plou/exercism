# TypeScript exercises

This folder contains solved TypeScript exercises from [exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript/exercises)

Tests are running with Jest, so I've followed instructions from [Jest oficial docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and [ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/docs/getting-started/installation/#jest-config-file) to configure dependencies, repository structure and so.

Test files are the same as defined in each exercise but applying minor changes, like update `xit` to `it` to avoid skipping some tests (which are actually run in remote env)

## Requirements

- [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install)

## How to operate

```bash
yarn install
